# dcap-sse
Metadata Application Profile for the Social and Solidarity Economy.

This repository contains the source files for the DCAP-SSE. Until October 2016, these were maintained on a server at [essglobal.org](http://essglobal.org/dcap-sse/). A reason for moving them is to allow other people to get involved in the maintenance and development of the DCAP-SSE.

## Use of branches in this repository

We are following exactly the process documented at http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/. Please make sure you are completely familiar with this process before making any changes here. As a consequence of following this branching model:

  - The master branch is updated only on release
  - The develop branch is the place to look for current activity.
